title: "About Me"
---

I am a graduate student at the Department of Geophysical Sciences at the University of Chicago. I am interested broadly in mammalian phylogenetics, paleobiology and ecomorphology. 
When I'm not working in museum collections, you can find me swimming in Lake Michigan or running along the Lakefront Trail.
